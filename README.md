# Case Front End Developer for DEPT

This project was done for a technical challenge to DEPT.
It's based an assignment to test your technical knowledge! The assignment has been devised with technical and visual developers in mind.
I chose the most visual challenge although I added some elements to give more value to the product! They provided us with a figma design which I have tried to replicate.

> Project built with:

- React
- JSX
- SASS

> Atomic design
> This project was done using an atomic design, which components folder have specific structure:

    .
    ├── components                  # This folder stores all the components.
    │   ├── atoms                   # Small components, like buttons or inputs.
    │   ├── molecules               # Containers or wrappers
    │   └── organism                # These components are sections of the page
    └── ...

## Highlights

- Added some schemas for the froms.
- I decided to make a json to treat the svg of the brands since the code was cleaner, more readable and reusable
- Animations Added

## Future improvements

Some of the things that I would have liked to implement that I could not due to time issues are:

- Implement some Testing
- Improve the modal when the menu is opened
- I would have liked to be implemented Mobile Design more aproach

## Feedback

My main idea for this project was to respect the design of the figma as much as possible and also try to give it value with a clean and reusable code.

In my opinion, this challenge helped me to:

- Continuing learning and programming as a front end
- Improve my knowledge of atomic design and abstraction of components.

Thanks to DEPT for giving me the opportunity to do this challenge, it was an incredible experience.

Although there have been days of a lot of work, I am happy with the result and this challenge has motivated me a lot!
